Framework for creating games! Don't expect anything good, as i haven't been using JavaScript for too long.

Just supposed to be a small project that i can reuse for my games. (unless i haven't already made a better version of this)
The name is a combination of "Nikaxe" and "Object". (both reduced to a few letters)
